## Motivation
 Existing RL methods face a critical dilemma in reward design:

*   **Rule-based rewards** are precise but brittle. They struggle to parse diverse answer formats, leading to incorrect penalties that stifle model learning.
*   **Model-based rewards** (using a fixed reward model) are more robust but are vulnerable to **reward hacking**. The policy model can learn to exploit loopholes in the reward model, achieving high scores for incorrect answers and causing performance to collapse.

This forces a difficult choice between a reward system that is precise but inflexible, and one that is adaptable but easily exploited. How can we get the best of both worlds?

</div>

This is where **Cooper** comes in. Cooper introduces a framework that **co-optimizes** both the policy and the reward model. It leverages the high precision of rule-based rewards to identify trustworthy positive samples, while an assistant LLM dynamically generates challenging negative samples.  This continuous stream of high-quality preference pairs is used to continuously refine the reward model, making it more robust and resistant to hacking. This dynamic process breaks the static reward dilemma, leading to more **stable** and **robust** RL training.

## ‚ú® Highlights

*   üí° **Co-Optimizing Framework**: Cooper is a novel framework to jointly and dynamically optimize both the policy and reward models during RL, breaking the limitations of static reward functions.
*   üõ°Ô∏è **Mitigates Reward Hacking**: By continuously updating the reward model with high-quality data, Cooper effectively prevents the policy model from exploiting its weaknesses, ensuring stable and meaningful training.
*   ‚öôÔ∏è **Dynamic Data Strategy**: Leverages a hybrid approach where high-precision rule-based rewards identify positive samples, and an assistant LLM generates challenging negative samples, constantly improving the reward model's accuracy.
*   üöÄ **Improved Performance & Robustness**: Experiments show that Cooper not only alleviates reward hacking but also improves end-to-end performance, achieving a 3.09% gain in average accuracy on Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct.

## üìä Dataset
We provide the dataset for training the VerifyRM in ```
dataset/VerifyRM_training_data.parquet```. This dataset contains 58.7K pairs of questions, answers and completions, with the completetions labeled as either correct(1) or incorrect(0).

---

## üöÄ Quick Start
### VerifyRM Training
For training VerifyRM, please specify the ```model_path``` in ```train_VerifyRM/train.py```. The ```data_path``` is set by default to ```dataset/VerifyRM_training_data.parquet```.

```bash
cd train_VerifyRM
bash run.sh
```
### Cooper Training
To start a training run with Cooper, you can use the provided shell script. For example, to train a 1.5B parameter model on gsm8k :

```bash
bash recipe/cooper/test_qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct.sh
```
Modify the following configurations in training scripts:

```bash
gsm8k_train_path=/path/to/your/gsm8k/train.parquet
gsm8k_test_path=/path/to/your/gsm8k/test.parquet
model_name_or_path=/path/to/your/qwen2.5-1.5b-instruct
reward_model_path=/path/to/your/reward_model
collaborator_model_path=/path/to/your/assistant_model
```

## üìà Main Result
### Reasoning Performance:
For all evaluations, we use a temperature of 0.7 and top-p of 0.95, generating 8 samples per problem and computing the average accuracy to mitigate evaluation variance.
